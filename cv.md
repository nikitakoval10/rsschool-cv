## About Myself

I'm 30 years old, currently working in a sports organisation. I have experience in printing[https://okprint.by/], sales [https://autostart.by/] and as a content manager [https://alphagreen.io/]. But I have always been looking for a more promising activity that I will really enjoy and get pleasure from the work I do, not just money. I'm sure that studying at Rolling Scopes will bring me closer to that because web development and design have always appealed to me!

## Skills:

- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript Basics
- SEO Promotion
- Adobe Photoshop (basic)
- Adobe Illustrator (basic)

## Code example

```javascript
const stringToNumber = function (str) {
  return Number(str);
};
```
