## About Myself

I'm 30 years old, currently working in a sports organisation. I have experience in printing ([okprint.by](https://okprint.by)), sales ([autostart.by](https://autostart.by)) and as a content-manager ([alphagreen.io](https://alphagreen.io)). But I have always been looking for a more promising activity that I will really enjoy and get pleasure from the work I do, not just money. I'm sure that studying at Rolling Scopes will bring me closer to that because web development and design have always appealed to me!
